# Front End Developer Assesment

## Tech Stack

This assessment repo is built on top of:
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/)

## Setup

You will need node 16+.

First, go ahead and fork the repository.  Pull down the code.

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Instructions
You will have 2-4 hours to complete tickets from a ticket pool.  Which tickets you choose to complete are up to you.

You are NOT allowed to install any additional npm packages, and must work within the confines of the given tech stack. For CSS, we prefer you use Tailwind/Daisy where possible, but falling back to vanilla CSS is okay.

You can use as much documentation and resources from the internet as you want, as long as you aren't receiving "live" help from any other person(s).

Each ticket should be submitted seperately via it's own PR/branch.

PR's sent in after the 4 hour mark will not be accepted.  However, partial completion of tickets will still be considered.

## Ready to begin?
Once you have the application running, email [Philip](mailto:philip@capeandbay.com) and let us know you are ready to begin.  You will be sent a link to a website containing the tickets.

## Completion

Email [Philip](mailto:philip@capeandbay.com) and let us know you are finished.  You will be contacted after our team has reviewed your work.
