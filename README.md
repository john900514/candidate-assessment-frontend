# Cape & Bay Front End Developer Assesment

## Tech Stack

This assessment repo is built on top of:
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Instructions
You will be given 2-4 hours to complete tickets from a ticket pool.  Which tickets you choose to complete are up to you. We include multiple ticket types ranging from fullstack/frontend/backend, and both bug fixes and new feature implementations.

Unless the ticket specifies otherwise, you are not allowed to add additional composer/npm packages, and must work within the confines of given tech stack. For CSS, we prefer you use Tailwind/Daisy where possible, and fallback to traditional scoped css.

You can use as much documentation and resources from the internet as you want, as long as there as you aren't receiving "live" help from any other person(s).

## Ready to begin?
Got the application stood up, and ready to go? Email [Philip](mailto:philip@capeandbay.com) saying you are ready for the tickets. Timer starts on email reply with tickets.

## Completion

Once you are done with the assessment, zip up the progress, and upload it to our google drive. Email [Philip](mailto:philip@capeandbay.com) with a list of tickets you attempted to complete, even if you made progress, but didn't quite finish all the way.
